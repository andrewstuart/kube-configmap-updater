# Refresher
## Auto-restart your k8s pods when dependent configuration maps are updated

To use:

- Deploy configmap-updater in your kubernetes cluster somewhere
- Label your pods with the `astuart.co/configMapUpdates` label, with any value.

Upon updating a configmap used by the labeled pods, all instances will be
deleted, allowing your deployment or replicationcontroller to scale them back
up.

## TODO

[ ] Use a rollout
